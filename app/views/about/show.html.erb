    This web application is a repository of Pokémon data, including types and abilities. 
    Data is organized according to an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that models the relationships between Pokémon, their types, and abilities.

  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    The information on this site is collected from various data sources and compiled into a relational database 
    to provide a comprehensive overview of each Pokémon and their characteristics.
